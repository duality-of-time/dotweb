<!--FAQ-->
	<h1 class=mainannouncehead>So what exactly is this?</h1>
	<p class=bodytext>
		Heyo! I'm glad you asked. Surprised you're here though. 
		<br> Anyway, this is the website for a game currently in development by one J. Allen.
		<br> No spoilers for the overall plot (that'll come in a demo soon ;))
		<br> But it takes place in a fictional version of prohibition-era New York, <br>
	where an average high-school student gets stuck. Their goal?
		<br> Escape with their life. 
		<br> Your goal? Play as them, both from a top-down perspective,
		<br>and from their first person-perspective.
		<br> More on that later.
		<br>
	</p>
	<h1 class=mainannouncehead>Ok??? What makes this unique?</h1>
		<p class=bodytext>
		Well, unlike a lot of other RPGs, you play from mixed perspectives.
		<br> When traversing the world, you play from a top down perspective.
		<br> Kind of inspired by RPGs of the 90's and a "certain" 2 from the 2010's.
		<br> The artstyle? Pixel. The music? Mostly chiptune.
		<br> But during battles, and certain segments?
		<br> First-person 3D. 
		<br> Hyper-detailed graphics. High-quality music. Everything you'd expect from a modern RPG.
	</p>
	<h1 class=mainannouncehead>Sounds cool! When can I download it?</h1>
		<p class=bodytext>
			Depends on how life goes. Right now, I have a... lack of hardware.
			<br> I'm saving up, of course, but uh... I haven't made much headway.
			<br> I do plan to get a decent rig decently soon, so that's good.
			<br> Current projected release date, though? 
			<br> I'd say sometime late 2029, maybe early 2030.
			<br> After all, I'm a very busy girl. Not legally a busy woman yet,
			<br> but a busy woman nonetheless, if you catch my drift.
